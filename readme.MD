4 function calculator
---------------------

**PREVIEW.html has CSS and JS inside it. All in one file.**


Took a while. 
innerText is sometimes cooperative.
firefox quicksearch on '/' key is annoying.

Can do compound operations, exponents, keyboard / buttons.
Clear nukes the page bc of innerText problems.

I am happy that this works now.
